**6to5** turns ES6 code into vanilla ES5, so you can use ES6 features **today.**

 - **Fast** - no redundant code added so your compiled code is as fast as possible.
 - **Extensible** - with a large range of [plugins](#plugins) and **browser support**.
 - **Lossless** - **source map support** so you can debug your compiled code with ease.
 - **Compact** - maps directly to the equivalent ES5 with **no runtime**.
 - **Concise** - does not pollute scope with unnecessary variables.

## Installation

It's as easy as:

    $ npm install -g 6to5
