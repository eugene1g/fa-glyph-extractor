"Font-blast" takes an icon font (such as Font Awesome, Bootstrap Glyphicons, or anything from Fontello), and creates individual SVG and PNG files for each icon within that font.

There are several use-cases for this:

 - **Use the icons offline** - you can use each icon individually in Sketch, Illustrator, PowerPoint, or any other app.
 - **Modify & repackage** - you can revise or combine individual icons, then repackage them into a custom font again (with other good tools) 
 - **Get high-quality PNG files** - no more screenshots, just high-quality image files.

Many of the popular icon-fonts have already been extracted and are available in the related repository at ...

## Installation

The package is self-sustained and is super fast - there are no nasty binary dependencies. 

    $ npm install font-blast
